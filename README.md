<h1 align="center"> Hello. I'm Jorge </h1>

<p>
 studied electronics engineering, learned C language and programmed PIC microcontrollers with it. I worked at the same time at Volkswagen, where in the first ten years I developed Windows applications in Visual Basic and Oracle databases, accumulating a lot of experience in SQL scripting. The last ten years I have developed projects for the automation of industrial processes (PLCs and motion control). Not just the programs, but also designing solutions from scratch. Automation solution process... (Analysis and discovery of the 'State Model' and its relationships and transitions), is very similar to object-oriented application, when it finds the Classes, inheritances, properties and methods, etc.

I love new challenges, constantly learning, being aware of new technologies and working in a modern, participatory and collaborative environment. That is why I want to be part of a technology company soon, where I can realize this change of course towards the world of web applications, remote work, lifelong learning ...

I am currently focused on acquiring the largest stack possible. I have completed .Net Core C # courses at UTN, Web apps: HTML / CSS / Boostrap / JavaScript / Python / Django / SQlite at edx Harvard and currently pursuing a Full Stack degree at I am Henry: GIT / GitHub / JavaScript / React Redux / Node Js / Express / Sequalize / PostgreSQL.
